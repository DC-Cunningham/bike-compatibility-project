## Description

A React-based application deployed using a Mongo, Express, Node and Material UI build.

This project is a proof of concept for an application dealing with the intricate compatibility relationships of bicycle components. The application hopes to make a user friendly database of information for bicycle industry. It shows which other components can come into contact with, and also which other components can influence any individual component. By having a quick at hand reference less issues can result from not considering all possible compatibility issues.

The application employs role based authentication that has a user and an admin level. Users are able to see the database but not edit or add components. An admin role can add and edit components.

When the user loads the main page, they are given the ability to search the BoogleBooks database:

- Once a search is done a list of books is rendered from the search request, within this list the user is able to save books to a Mongo database.
