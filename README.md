## Description

A React-based application deployed using a Mongo, Express, Node and Material UI build.

This project is a proof of concept for an application dealing with the intricate compatibility relationships of bicycle components. The application hopes to make a user friendly database of information for bicycle industry. It shows which other components can come into contact with, and also which other components can influence any individual component. By having a quick at hand reference less repair, replacement or customisation issues will result from not considering all possible compatibility issues.

The application employs role based authentication that has a user and an admin level. Users are able to see the database but not edit or add components. An admin role can add and edit components.

## Installation

The application has been deployed on Heroku [here](https://floating-retreat-84078.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

Upon signing in a user is able to search the component database:

- Once a user has chosen the component they are interested in they will see the details displayed for that item. Within the details pane there are all the components relationships which are all able to be clicked through to. The useer is also able to click out to a new browser window with a wikipedia link for the component.

Upon signing in as an admin the user is able to add more compnents to the database. They are also able to edit any of the current components.

## Future Plans and Known Bugs

- better control over routing for user roles

- integration of component measurement types and potential values

- a tooltip or the like that can be filled to define an influence between components

- a mechanism to check for reciprocal relationships, for example if one component is linked to another it's relationship is checked to be mirrored by the other.

- sorting of buttons in the component linking panels.

- functionality to the password reset mechanism.
